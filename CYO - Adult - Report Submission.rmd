## Overview

In this project, I intend to use information on adults from the 1994 Census database to predict whether individuals had an income higher than $50,000 or not based on certain known features about the individuals.

The dataset I used for this project comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). It consists of 14 features and 1 outcome. The features are listed here:

```{r features}
invisible(source("CYO - Adult - R Script Submission.R"))

names(adult[,-15])
```
